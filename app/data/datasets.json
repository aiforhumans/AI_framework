        "response": "Romeo and Juliet was written by the Italian poet William Shakespeare, born in 1564. He is one of the most influential playwrights and poets in the English language. The play is part of a larger work called The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, which includes two more plays: The Capulet's Vision and The Mourning of Romeo. Shakespeare is credited with writing these works, although the exact date of his birth and death are uncertain. The play was first performed in London around 1597 or 1598, likely based on a story that may have been originally written by another playwright, possibly Christopher Marlowe. However, Shakespeare's version became the definitive form for centuries.",

The war officially concluded with the surrender of Japan, but the formal surrender of Germany took place on May 7, 1945, and the formal surrender of Italy on September 8, 1945, which are also sometimes cited as the end of the war. However, the year commonly referenced as the end of World War II is 1945 because it marks the cessation of hostilities in all major theaters of the war. This is when the Potsdam Declaration was issued and the Allies began to plan for the post-war order.\n\nFor a more precise date in terms of military cessation, the end of the fighting in Europe was marked by V-E Day (Victory in Europe) on May 8-9, 1945, while Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945, following the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's announcement of its own surrender.",
